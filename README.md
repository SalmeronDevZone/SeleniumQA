# SeleniumQA


Welcome to my GitHub repository! Here, you'll find various projects and experiments predominantly centered around Python programming language. While Python remains my primary focus, I also have an interest in exploring and incorporating C# and Kotlin into my repertoire.

Projects
Python Projects: You'll find a variety of Python projects covering different domains such as data analysis, machine learning, web development, and more.
